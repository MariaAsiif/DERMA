It can affect the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, and other parts of the body. Hair loss can occur gradually or suddenly, and it can be temporary or permanent, depending on the underlying causes.",

            "Androgenetic Alopecia: Also known as male or female pattern baldness, androgenetic alopecia is the most common type of hair loss. It is characterized by a gradual thinning of hair, usually starting from the temples or crown of the head. In men, this type of hair loss often leads to a receding hairline and bald patches. In women, it typically results in overall hair thinning.",
            "Alopecia Areata: Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition that causes hair loss in patches. It occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the hair follicles, leading to sudden hair loss. The affected areas may be smooth and round, and the hair loss can occur on the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, or other parts of the body.",
            "Telogen Effluvium: Telogen effluvium is a temporary form of hair loss that occurs when there is a disruption in the hair growth cycle. It can be triggered by factors such as physical or emotional stress, hormonal changes, illness, nutritional deficiencies, or certain medications. Hair shedding is usually more noticeable during washing or brushing, and the condition often resolves on its own over time..",
            "Traction Alopecia: Traction alopecia is hair loss caused by excessive tension or pulling on the hair. It is commonly seen in individuals who frequently wear tight hairstyles such as ponytails, braids, or cornrows. The constant strain on the hair follicles can lead to hair breakage and thinning in the affected areas.",
            "Trichotillomania:Trichotillomania is a psychological condition characterized by an irresistible urge to pull out one's hair. People with this disorder may compulsively pull hair from the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, or other areas. The repeated hair pulling can result in noticeable hair loss and bald patches",

Surgical excision is commonly used for larger or suspicious moles, as it allows for the mole to be examined further through pathology testing.",

Shave excision is a quick and straightforward procedure.",

The laser targets the melanin in the mole, gradually lightening or removing it. Laser removal is generally suitable for smaller, flat moles.
