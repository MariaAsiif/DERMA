The dermatologist will numb the area around the mole, then carefully remove the mole and close the wound with stitches. Surgical excision is commonly used for larger or suspicious moles, as it allows for the mole to be examined further through pathology testing.",

The dermatologist will numb the area, then carefully shave off the mole, usually leaving the skin smooth and allowing it to heal naturally without stitches. Shave excision is a quick and straightforward procedure.",
            "Laser Removal: Laser removal involves using laser technology to break down the pigmented cells within the mole. The laser targets the melanin in the mole, gradually lightening or removing it. Laser removal is generally suitable for smaller, flat moles. Multiple laser sessions may be required for optimal results."
